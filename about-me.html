                <p>The strange thing about me is, I like fried food but I don't like the oil contained in the fried food,
                I don't like eating fried food when it's hot in the middle of the day without eating utensils,
                I always have to wash my hands with soap if I eat fried food using my bare hands or without eating utensils, 
                or I will feel uncomfortable just because there is a lot of oil on my hands, and the smell of oil in the fried food.
                I like sweet foods but always sneeze every time I eat sweet foods such as cake or chocolate.</p>
